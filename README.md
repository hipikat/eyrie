# Ada's Eyrie Repo

Just a personal project in which I try to set up a little space for myself on
the internet, and learn a bunch of stuff as I go. For those following along on
a Mac, you'll just need to `brew install vagrant && brew install --cask virtualbox`.

- `vagrant up eyrie-dev` brings up a Salt-provisioned development box
