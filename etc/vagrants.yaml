# Vagrant/VirtualBox VM definitions
#
# (Use `vagrant status [box]` to see the list of defined boxes, and
# `vagrant (up|destroy|provision) [box]` to manage their lifecycles.)
#
# - Leading underscores exclude boxes from the list of VM definitions
# - The _base-box has all the essentials
# - The 'packages' list is a list of packages to `apt get` during provisioning
# - The 'states' list applies Salt states (.sls files) from etc/salt/root/
# - The 'virtualbox' hash gets applied directly to the "virtualbox" provider
